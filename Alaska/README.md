# Assignment01 Heuristic Evaluation - Juan Jovany Pompa, DH 110
## Exploring Alaska's Department of Fish & Game and Public Safety
After recently visiting Alaska I realized that finding current outdoor activities to do and getting a hold of local authorities seems to be a bit of a challenge for a person who is coming from out of state and has no idea how the state works. This is why I chose to do a heuristic evaluation of Alaska's department of Fish and Game and Public Safety. So that hopefully tourist of all ages can navigate the webpages effortlessly and most imoprtantly get the information they need.
## Alaska's Department of Fish and Game
The website for Alaska's Department of Fish and Game works in conjuction with Alaska's official state website. Here users are able to see the states policy and management decisions regarding fisheries and game units, along with educational content and outreach programs. The goal of the department of Fish and Game is to optimize public participation in fish and wildlife pursuits and increase public knowledge and confidence that wild populations of fish and wildlife are responsibly managed

### Evaluation
Overall the webage seems to have an abundance of information that seems to have all the answers to a persons question pertaining to Fish and Game. With clear icons and descriptions a person of any age can get a sense of the type of wild animals the state deals with. The press information on the home page can seem like alot to take in but clear labels point a user in whichever direction they want to take.

Heuristic | Fish & Game Department Heuristic Evaluation
--------- | --------------------------------
**1. Visibility of System Status:** The web/app design should give users feedback on their completed actions almost immidiately. | **Good:** -Relevant categories pop up when hovering over a label on the home page and the irrelevant categories go away. -Headers enclose relevant information with a line to let readers know that the information pertains to a certain topic. **Review:** The department does a good job of letting users know where they are at on the page and what information they are going to view, making this heuristic not too much of an issue on the page.
**2. Match between system and the real world:** The icons and language of the design should be universal allowing all people to comprehend its information. | **Good:** -they have definitions for their native terms that are culturally appropriate so users can understand. **Bad:** It has abbreviations for phrases and terms, which can confuse a user who doesn't know what they're talking about. **Review:** The department could write out terms and phrases to make them more understable and not so confusing to users.
**3. User control and freedom:** The web/app design should allow users to easily retract unwanted actions without having to go through an extra process | **Good:** -There is a back to the top of the page option once a user reaches the bottom which allows them to to go up at the touch a button. -The users previous searched history is saved when they go to type in a new search. **Review:** Control and freedom feattures seem to be decent for the user, but they can definetely add a back button so a user doesn't have to keep clicking back and forth between categories.
**4. Consistency and standards:** The web/app should not have similar meaning words, situations, or actions. If this is the case the value of reliability decreases | **Bad:** - Search bar icon is not clickable, it typically is on websites. **Review** Making icons such as the search bar icon clickable would improve the webpages consistency.
**5. Error prevention:** Preventing user errors before they occur, or letting the user know an error will occur if they proceed. | **Review:** Overall users are easily able to retract their steps if they ever make a mistake of clicking on the wrong files, I see no issues here.
**6. Recognition rather than recall:** Minimizing a users cognitive load is key. While using the interface users should not have to keep thinking about how to progress or regress. Having consistent visible labels helps this. | **Good:**  - They make it easy for users to identify topics and information by having relative pictures next to the information. **Review:** The webpage has alot of pictures that are relevant to the information, which makes it easy for the user to remember and know where info is at. Making recognition rather than recall easy for the user.
**7. Flexibility and efficiency of use:** This allows experienced and novice users to use the interface at how they like. Allowing for flexible usage which increases efficiency. | **Good:** -They have a shop as a guest or sign in feature for buying licensing, permits and tags. Which allows the user to have one's information saved if they sign up one time, increasing efficiency. **Review:** The page gives experienced users the option to more quickly go through buying features making efficiency of use good.
**8. Aesthetic and minimalist design:** An overload of information and design can lead users to not want to use the web/app, which is why a simpler and more appealing look gives better user experience. | **Good:** -Aside from general fish and game information, the website also includes the disagreement and agreements different parts of the state have with one another. This is information that a tourist does not need to know and it also crowds up all the information displayed. **Review:** The department can do a better job of taking unimportant information off of the main page.
**9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors:** Users should clearly be aware of when an issue arises while using an interface, therefore having understable precise error messages and solutions is key. | **Bad:** -There's no notice that lets a user know theyâ€™re exiting the fish and game department when they click on a link that says myAlaska at the top of the page, this can confuse a user because they wouldn't know that that link takes them out of the department page. **Review:** The department should have pop ups that let a user know they are leaving the departments page.
**10. Help and documentation:** There should be clear troubleshooting information somewhere on the interface where the user can comfortably and reliably go in case of an issue. Sort of like guest services at a physical location. | **Good** - The webpage has external links at the bottom of each page so that users are able to get further information pertaining to the topic. **Review:** Assistance and clarity are well displayed when clicking on different topics.

### Severity Rating 

1. Top Priority: Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
2. Important to fix: Consistency and standards
3. Small inconvienence: Match between system and the real world

Heuristic | Public Safety Department Heuristic Evaluation
--------- | --------------------------------
**1. Visibility of System Status:** The web/app design should give users feedback on their completed actions almost immidiately. | **Good:** -Yellow highlight as you click on categories. -Arrows light up blue when clicking to next picture. **Bad:** -Having a picture as a header instead of a title seems confusing and doesn't let you know what page you're on. -as you type in the search bar there are no drop down suggestions to click on, which makes it hard for a person to understand how they should be phrasing the term or question. -There are really no big headers that let you know what the text or pictures are talking about, You have to read the smaller text to know what the picture below is. **Review:** The department can do a better job of making users aware of the page they are on and what information they're reading before its read.
**2. Match between system and the real world:** The icons and language of the design should be universal allowing all people to comprehend its information. | **Good:** -Does have translation for indigenous terms. **Review:** Being that the page is about law enforcement everything is pretty technical and professional.
**3. User control and freedom:** The web/app design should allow users to easily retract unwanted actions without having to go through an extra process | **Good:** - Gives the user the ability to respond to safety concerns via text or through a web link, which gives the user a lot of freedom in choosing what action to take. **Review:** Users can easily navigate out of webpages they did not intend to click on and can easily solve the issue of accidently sending a wrong report, making control and freedom a good aspect of the page.
**4. Consistency and standards:** The web/app should not have similar meaning words, situations, or actions. If this is the case the value of reliability decreases | **Review:** Terms are pretty technical being its about law enforcement, so there is consistency and standardization throughout the page.
**5. Error prevention:** Preventing user errors before they occur, or letting the user know an error will occur if they proceed. | **Bad:** Search engine could offer suggestions, because if a person phrases a question or term wrong then they end up at a page that says no results. **Review:** The webpage would be better in this aspect if it gave users predetermined terms or concerns to click on.
**6. Recognition rather than recall:** Minimizing a users cognitive load is key. While using the interface users should not have to keep thinking about how to progress or regress. Having consistent visible labels helps this. | **Good:** -They have clear short descriptions of valuable information, followed by a more detailed description. **Bad:** -There are only a little bit of icons displayed. **Review:** Being that this is a public safety page I would say that in general it makes it easy for people to remember important information and know where it is at.
**7. Flexibility and efficiency of use:** This allows experienced and novice users to use the interface at how they like. Allowing for flexible usage which increases efficiency. | **Good:** -When searching for the daily dispatch, users have the option to either click on the calendar and pick a date or enter the date manually which gives the user flexibility on how they want to search up dispatches. **Review:** The department makes it easy for users to give information in numerous ways, which is good being that it deals with legal matters and legal matter data can take many forms.
**8. Aesthetic and minimalist design:** An overload of information and design can lead users to not want to use the web/app, which is why a simpler and more appealing look gives better user experience. | **Review:** Although the webpage style isn't minimal it does give the user all the information they need to know. So the trade off of not having a minimalist design here is being able to give a lot of information, which is good in this case since it pertains to one's safety and oftentimes people want to know as much as possible.
**9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors:** Users should clearly be aware of when an issue arises while using an interface, therefore having understable precise error messages and solutions is key. | **Good:** -When trying to see how one can physically contact a police office, there's a big display of block text in red at the top that say that option is not available, which makes it easy and understandable for the user to look for one of the other alternatives. **Review:** The department does a good job of letting users know there could be issue if they decided to do one thing compared to another.
**10. Help and documentation:** There should be clear troubleshooting information somewhere on the interface where the user can comfortably and reliably go in case of an issue. Sort of like guest services at a physical location. | **Review:** They make the resources and contact information clearly available to the user at the top of the page, with drop down options. I see no issues here.
