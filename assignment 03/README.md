# DH 110 Assignment 03: Contextual Inquiry 
## Introductory Steps 
### Step 01: Specify the research and goal requirements 

#### What is the main activity your project would support for your users? 
This project would support the users in more easily finding various forms of wildlife along with the locations they appear at. Making prepping for wildlife viewing go smoothly. 

#### What is the basic need involved for this activity? 
The activity fulfills the users basic need for wanting to explore the wildlife of Alaska.

#### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
Current solutions to satisfy the users need include having an interactive map users can use to determine what parts of Alaska are accessible and what type of wildife there is in each part. 

#### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
limitations that could be improved on Alaska's Department of Fish and Game include having what wildlife is available to view, and where and when to view wildlife on the same page as one another. As of right now each option is seperated into different categories making the users toggle from page to page, causing them more remember more information than needed.

### Step 02: Target users

#### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise) 
Demographics: People traveling to Alaska (Tourist, researchers), Alaska citizens. 

Prefences: With Alaska being such a big state people who are searching for wild animals want to be able to know the places at which certain animals live and the times they are out.

Expertise: Users do not need any certain level of expertise to use this webpage

#### In which context (where, why) would the users do that activity?
Users would complete this activity typically at their home or wherever there is wifi. And they would do this because they want to plan ahead before going out into the wilderness and being lost. 

#### What do/did the users usually do in order to complete that activity? 
Typically users visit information centers in person, or use the webpages interactive map to determine which place they prefer to visit. 

### Step 03: Pick an qualitative research method (or a combination/adaptation of methods)

I used a combination of participatory observation and interview 
  - For participatory observation I observed one activity and that was having the user look up the type of animal they would like to view and the location at which the animal can be seen. 
  - For the interview I met with the user via zoom and I was only able to record the sound being that the user was using a mobile device too access the website and they could share their screen. 
  - The software I used to record is called Screen Recorder Pro 

### Step 04: Conducting the Research

### Step 05: Reflection

Context inquiry seems to be a much smoother process than UT pilot studies being that the user is in control of what they do and say, so there are no interruptions from technological issues or confusions while completing the interview. Discussing questions that lead up to the activity seem to be important in prepping the user for the activity one observes and it allows them to really grasp what makes things difficult and easy while completing the activity. While gathering the data I find it really important to have the user think out loud so that as the researcher, one can really step into their shoes to understand the good and the bad about the process as a whole. Along with this, asking follow up questions at the end brings clearer insight into what can be improved and what already works. If I were to conduct another interview I would like to ask the user some warm up questions and have them decide what activity to complete. I feel like doing this would bring a much more natural aspect to the interview and data results. Furthermore, allowing the user to have more control during the interview would help me as the researcher ask more questions about why and how they do things. Which I find to be better, because having the users complete a specific task I tell them to complete reduces the chances of issues popping up, which would be considered missing data.
